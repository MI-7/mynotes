Environments
</h3>
<pre>
<font color=green>translation environments</font>= in which source code is converted into executable machine instructions
<font color=green>execution environments</font>= in which the code actually runs

translation environment can be different from execution environment.  for example, cross-compilers run on one machine but
produce executable code that will be run on a different type of machine.

nor is an operating system a requirement.  the standard also discusses freestanding environments, in which there is no operating system.

Attacks
</h3>
<pre>
<font color=green>Cryptanalysis</font> = the science of studying attacks against cryptographic schemes
Attacks usually tries to reveal plaintext from ciphertext.  Or even, recover the key.

Eve may have full information of plaintext or ciphertext.  But may not have the key.

Classifications of Attacks:
1. Ciphertext-only attack: Eve have <font color=green>ciphertexts</font>.
One must assume that she can get access to encrypted messages.
An encryption method that cannot resist a ciphertext-only attack is completely insecure.

2. Known-plaintext attack: Eve have <font color=green>plaintext-ciphertext pairs</font>.
Using the information from these pairs, she attempts to decrypt a ciphertext for which she does not have the plaintext.
Messages may be sent in standard formats which Eve knows.

3. Chosen-plaintext attack: Eve has the ability to obtain <font color=green>ciphertexts for plaintexts of her choosing</font>.
Then she attempts to decrypt a ciphertext for which she does not have the plaintext.
For example, she may send some interesting information to her intended victim which she is confident
he will encrypt and send out.
This type of attack assumes that Eve must first obtain whatever plaintext-ciphertext pairs she wants
and then do her analysis, without any further interaction.
This means that she only needs access to the encrypting device once.

4. Adaptively-chosen-plaintext attack.
This is the same as the previous attack, except that now Eve may do some analysis on the plaintext-ciphertext
pairs, and subsequently get more pairs.
She may switch between gathering pairs and performing the analysis as often as she likes.
This means that she either has lengthy <font color=green>access to the encrypting device</font> or can somehow make repeated use of it.

5. Chosen- and adaptively-chosen-ciphertext attacks.
These two attacks are similar to the above plaintext attacks.
Eve can choose ciphertexts and get the corresponding plaintexts. She has access to the decryption device.

are the basic building blocks (also called cryptographic primitives) for solving problems
involving <font color=green>secrecy, authentication or data integrity</font>.

In many cases a single building block is not sufficient to solve the given
problem: different primitives must be combined. A series of steps must be executed to accomplish a given task.

<font color=green>Cryptographic Protocols</font> = Well-defined series of steps.  e.g.
1. Bob randomly chooses a ¡°challenge¡± c and sends it to Alice.
2. Alice signs c with her secret key, s := Sign(sk, c), and sends the ¡°response¡± to Bob.
3. Bob accepts Alice¡¯s proof of identity if Verify(pk, s, c) = ok.
