Environments
</h3>
<pre>
<font color=green>translation environments</font>= in which source code is converted into executable machine instructions
<font color=green>execution environments</font>= in which the code actually runs

translation environment can be different from execution environment.  for example, cross-compilers run on one machine but
produce executable code that will be run on a different type of machine.

nor is an operating system a requirement.  the standard also discusses freestanding environments, in which there is no operating system.

Translation
</h3>
<pre>
The <font color="green">translation phase</font> consists of several steps:
First, each of the source files that make up a program are individually converted to object code via the <font color="green">compilation process</font>.
Then, the various object files are tied together by the linker to form a single, complete executable program.
The linker also brings in any functions from the standard C libraries used in the program, and it also search personal libraries as well.

The compilation process itself consists of several phases:
* preprocessor = text manipulation on source code (substitute #define; read #include files)
* parse = source code is parsed to determine the meanings of its statements, object code is then generated
* optimizer is optional till your program is fully debugged

File Name Conventions:
* source code: *.c
* header file: *.h
* object file: *.o (Unix Systems); *.obj (Windows)

1. To compile and link a C program that is contained entirely in one source file:
      <font color="green">cc program.c</font>
Produces an executable program called a.out. An object file called program.o is produced, but deleted after the linking is complete.
2. To compile and link several C source files:
      <font color="green">cc main.c sort.c lookup.c</font>
3. To compile one C source file and link it whit existing object files:
      <font color="green">cc main.o lookup.o sort.c</font>
4. To compile a single C source file and produce an object file (in this case, called program.o) for later linking:
      <font color="green">cc -c program.c</font>
5. To compile several C source files and produce an object file for each:
      <font color="green">cc -c main.c sort.c lookup.c</font>
6. To link several object files:
      <font color="green">cc main.o sort.o lookup.o</font>
