How BitCoin Works?
</h3>
<p class="m0">
<img src="globalbitcoin.jpg" height="200" width="400"></img>
</p>
<p/>
<p class="m0">
the bitcoin system
consists of<p/>
* users with wallets containing keys<p/>
* transactions that are propagated
across the network<p/>
* and miners who produce (through competitive
computation) the consensus blockchain, which is the authoritative ledger of all
transactions.<p/>
<img src=fig1.6-bitcointransaction.png></img>
</p>
<p/>
<p class="m0">
While tracking
a transaction through the bitcoin network to the blockchain, we will use a
blockchain explorer site to visualize each step. A blockchain explorer is a
web application that operates as a bitcoin search engine, in that it allows you
to search for addresses, transactions, and blocks and see the relationships and
flows between them.
</p>
<p/>
<p class="m0">
Popular blockchain explorers include:<p/>
* <a href=https://blockexplorer.com>Bitcoin Block Explorer</a><p/>
* <a href=https://live.blockcypher.com>BlockCypher Explorer</a><p/>
* <a href=https://blockchain.info>blockchain.info</a><p/>
* <a href=https://insight.bitpay.com>BitPay Insight</a><p/>
Each of these has a search function that can take a <font color=red>bitcoin address, transaction
hash, block number, or block hash</font> and retrieve corresponding information from
the bitcoin network.

* Alice buys a coffee from Bob's Cafe<p/>
* The POS machine generates a QR code containing the payment request<p/>
<img src=fig1.8-bobcafeqrcode.png></img><p/>
* The QR code is a bitcoin url:<p/>

* The URL contains several key information:<p/>
<I><B>
A bitcoin address: "1GdK9UzpHBzqzX2A9JFP3Di4weBwqgmoQA"<br>
The payment amount: "0.015"<br>
A label for the recipient address: "Bob's Cafe"<br>
A description for the payment: "Purchase at Bob's Cafe"<br>
</I></B>
<p/>
* Alice's wallet issue a transaction to Bob's Cafe on the blockchain.<p/>

<h3 class="mt0 mb1 slate h5">Typical Transaction Types</h3>

<p class="m0">
Common Transactions<p/>
* Simple Payment from one address to another address<br>
* Sometimes a change is made to previous transaction's output<br>

<p class="m0">
Aggregated Transactions<p/>
Aggregate several inputs into a single input.  This is equivalent to
the real world situation which you use lots of coins to form a bigger note.<p/>
<img src=fig1.12-aggregatingtransaction.png></img><p/>
</p>
<p/>
<p class="m0">
Distributed Transactions<p/>
Distributes one input to multiple outputs representing multiple recipients.
Just like processing a payroll.<p/>

<h3 class="mt0 mb1 slate h2 blue">Construct Transactions</h3>

<p class="m0">
Usually a user's wallet keeps track of the outputs that can be used as inputs in future transactions.<p/>
Full node client stores a copy of all the un-spent outputs from every transaction in the blockchain.<p/>
While lightweight client stores only the un-spent outputs related to the current user.<p/>
Sometimes the wallet doesn't maintain the unspents transactions.  It will query bitcoin network to retrieve this info.<p/>

<img src="fig1.5-sendbitcoin.png" height="300" width="300"></img>
<br>Joe scanned Alice's QR Code and initiate the transfer
<p class="m0">
The wallet will:<p/>
* construct a transaction assigning 0.1 BTC to Alice's address<p/>
* sourcing the funds from Joe¡¯s wallet and signing the transaction with Joe¡¯s private keys. This tells the bitcoin
network that Joe has authorized a transfer of value to Alice¡¯s new address.<p/>
* The transaction is transmitted via the peer-to-peer protocol, it quickly
propagates across the bitcoin network. In less than a second, most of the well-
connected nodes in the network receive the transaction and see Alice¡¯s address
for the first time.<p/>
* Meanwhile, Alice¡¯s wallet is constantly ¡°listening¡± to published transactions
on the bitcoin network, looking for any that match the addresses in her wallets.<p/>
* A few seconds after Joe¡¯s wallet transmits the transaction, Alice¡¯s wallet will
indicate that it is receiving 0.10 BTC.<p/>
</p>
<p/>
<p class="m0">
At first, Alice¡¯s address will show the transaction from Joe as <font color=red>¡°Unconfirmed.¡±</font> This
means that the transaction has been propagated to the network but has not yet been
recorded in the <font color=red>bitcoin transaction ledger</font>, known as the <font color=red>blockchain</font>. To be confirmed, a
transaction must be included in a block and added to the blockchain, which happens
every 10 minutes, on average. In traditional financial terms this is known as clearing.
